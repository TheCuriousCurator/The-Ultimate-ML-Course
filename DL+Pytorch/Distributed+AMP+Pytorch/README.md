distributed training APIs offered by PyTorch
- torch.distributed, 
- torch.multiprocessing 
- torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler 

that make distributed training look easy.

Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) tools
- torch.cuda.amp.autocast 
- torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler 

to reduce the memory footprint while training deep learning models faster.

Libraries such as Horovod, DeepSpeed, and PyTorch Lightning provide sleek APIs to facilitate distributed training of PyTorch models.
