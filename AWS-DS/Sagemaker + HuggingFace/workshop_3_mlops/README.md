## Workshop 3: **MLOps: End-to-End Hugging Face Transformers with the Hub & SageMaker Pipelines**

In Workshop 3 learn how to build an End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Hugging Face Transformers from training to production using Amazon SageMaker.

We are going to create an automated SageMaker Pipeline which:

- processes a dataset and uploads it to s3
- fine-tunes a Hugging Face Transformer model with the processed dataset
- evaluates the model against an evaluation set
- deploys the model if it performed better than a certain threshold
