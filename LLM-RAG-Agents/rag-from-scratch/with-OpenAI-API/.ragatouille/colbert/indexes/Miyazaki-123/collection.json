  "Hayao Miyazaki (\u5bae\u5d0e \u99ff or \u5bae\ufa11 \u99ff, Miyazaki Hayao, [mija\ua71czaki hajao]; born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese animator, filmmaker, and manga artist. A founder and the honorary chairman of Studio Ghibli, he has attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and creator of Japanese animated feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\nBorn in Tokyo City, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age.",
  "Born in Tokyo City, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age. He joined Toei Animation in 1963, working as an inbetween artist and key animator on films like Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon (1965), Puss in Boots (1969), and Animal Treasure Island (1971), before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the Third Part I (1971\u20131972) alongside Isao Takahata. After moving to Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d (later Nippon Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater and directed the television series Future Boy Conan (1978).",
  "He joined Tokyo Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first feature film The Castle of Cagliostro (1979) and the television series Sherlock Hound (1984\u20131985). He wrote and illustrated the manga Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (1982\u20131994) and directed the 1984 film adaptation produced by Topcraft.\nMiyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985, writing and directing films such as Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbor Totoro (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), and Porco Rosso (1992), which were met with critical and commercial success in Japan.",
  "Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke (1997) was the first animated film to win the Japan Academy Film Prize for Picture of the Year and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan; its Western distribution increased Ghibli's worldwide popularity and influence. Spirited Away (2001) became Japan's highest-grossing film and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature; it is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 21st century. Miyazaki's later films\u2014Howl's Moving Castle (2004), Ponyo (2008), and The Wind Rises (2013)\u2014also enjoyed critical and commercial success. He retired from feature films in 2013 but later returned to make The Boy and the Heron (2023), which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.",
  "He retired from feature films in 2013 but later returned to make The Boy and the Heron (2023), which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\nMiyazaki's works are frequently subject to scholarly analysis and have been characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. His protagonists are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in 2014.",
  "Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in the town Akebono-cho in Hong\u014d, Tokyo City, Empire of Japan, the second of four sons. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki (born 1915), was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, his brother's company, which manufactured rudders for fighter planes during World War II. The business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's early life. Miyazaki's father enjoyed purchasing paintings and demonstrating them to guests, but otherwise had little known artistic understanding.",
  "The business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's early life. Miyazaki's father enjoyed purchasing paintings and demonstrating them to guests, but otherwise had little known artistic understanding. He was in the Imperial Japanese Army around 1940, discharged and lectured about disloyalty after declaring to his commanding officer that he wished not to fight because of his wife and young child. According to Miyazaki, his father often told him about his exploits, claiming he continued to attend nightclubs after turning 70. Katsuji Miyazaki died on March 18, 1993. After his death, Miyazaki felt he had often looked at his father negatively and that he had never said anything \"lofty or inspiring\".",
  "After his death, Miyazaki felt he had often looked at his father negatively and that he had never said anything \"lofty or inspiring\". He regretted not having a serious discussion with his father, and felt he had inherited his \"anarchistic feelings and his lack of concern about embracing contradictions\".\n\nSome of Miyazaki's earliest memories are of \"bombed-out cities\". In 1944, when he was three years old, Miyazaki's family evacuated to Utsunomiya. After the bombing of Utsunomiya in July 1945, he and his family evacuated to Kanuma. The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, then aged four.",
  "After the bombing of Utsunomiya in July 1945, he and his family evacuated to Kanuma. The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, then aged four. As a child, Miyazaki suffered from digestive problems, and was told he would not live beyond 20, making him feel like an outcast; he considered himself \"clumsy and weak\", protected at school by his older brother. From 1947 to 1955, Miyazaki's mother Yoshiko suffered from spinal tuberculosis; she spent the first few years in hospital before being nursed from home, forcing Miyazaki and his siblings to take over domestic duties. Yoshiko was frugal, and described as a strict, intellectual woman who regularly questioned \"socially accepted norms\".",
  "Yoshiko was frugal, and described as a strict, intellectual woman who regularly questioned \"socially accepted norms\". She was closest with Miyazaki, and had a strong influence on him and his later work. Yoshiko Miyazaki died in July 1983 at the age of 72.\nMiyazaki began school as an evacuee in 1947, at an elementary school in Utsunomiya, completing the first through third grades. After his family moved back to Suginami-ku in 1950, Miyazaki completed the fourth grade at \u014cmiya Elementary School, and fifth grade at Eifuku Elementary School, which was newly established after splitting off from \u014cmiya Elementary.",
  "After graduating from Eifuku as part of the first graduating class, he attended \u014cmiya Junior High School. He aspired to become a manga artist, but discovered he could not draw people; instead, he drew planes, tanks, and battleships for several years. Miyazaki was influenced by several manga artists, such as Tetsuji Fukushima, Soji Yamakawa and Osamu Tezuka. Miyazaki destroyed much of his early work, believing it was \"bad form\" to copy Tezuka's style as it was hindering his own development as an artist. He preferred to see artists like Tezuka as fellow artists rather than idols to worship.",
  "He preferred to see artists like Tezuka as fellow artists rather than idols to worship. Around this time, Miyazaki often saw movies with his father, who was an avid moviegoer; memorable films for Miyazaki include Meshi (1951) and Tasogare Sakaba (1955).\nAfter graduating from \u014cmiya Junior High, Miyazaki attended Toyotama High School. During his third and final year, Miyazaki's interest in animation was sparked by Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958), Japan's first feature-length animated film in color; he had sneaked out to watch the film instead of studying for his entrance exams.",
  "Miyazaki later recounted that, falling in love with its heroine, the film moved him to tears and left a profound impression, prompting him to create work true to his own feelings instead of imitating popular trends; he wrote the film's \"pure, earnest world\" promoted a side of him that \"yearned desperately to affirm the world rather than negate it\". After graduating from Toyotama, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University in the department of political economy, majoring in Japanese Industrial Theory; he considered himself a poor student as he instead focused on art. He joined the \"Children's Literature Research Club\", the \"closest thing back then to a comics club\"; he was sometimes the sole member of the club.",
  "He joined the \"Children's Literature Research Club\", the \"closest thing back then to a comics club\"; he was sometimes the sole member of the club. In his free time, Miyazaki would visit his art teacher from middle school and sketch in his studio, where the two would drink and \"talk about politics, life, all sorts of things\". Around this time, he also drew manga; he never completed any stories, but accumulated thousands of pages of the beginnings of stories. He also frequently approached manga publishers to rent their stories. In 1960, Miyazaki was a bystander during the Anpo protests, having developed an interest after seeing photographs in Asahi Graph; by that point, he was too late to participate in the demonstrations. Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics.",
  "Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nIn 1963, Miyazaki was employed at Toei Doga; this was the last year the company hired regularly. He began renting a four-and-a-half tatami (7.4 m2; 80 sq ft) apartment in Nerima, Tokyo, near Toei's studio; the rent was \u00a56,000, while his salary at Toei was \u00a519,500. Miyazaki worked as an inbetween artist on the theatrical feature films Doggie March (1963) and Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon (1965) and the television anime Wolf Boy Ken (1963).",
  "His proposed changes to the ending of Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon were accepted by its director; he was uncredited but his work was praised. Miyazaki found inbetween art unsatisfying and wanted to work on more expressive designs. He was a leader in a labor dispute soon after his arrival at Toei, and became chief secretary of its labor union in 1964; its vice-chairman was Isao Takahata, with whom Miyazaki would form a lifelong collaboration and friendship. Around this time, Miyazaki questioned his career choice and considered leaving the industry; a screening of The Snow Queen in 1964 moved him, prompting him to continue working \"with renewed determination\".",
  "Around this time, Miyazaki questioned his career choice and considered leaving the industry; a screening of The Snow Queen in 1964 moved him, prompting him to continue working \"with renewed determination\". \nDuring production of the anime series Sh\u014dnen Ninja Kaze no Fujimaru (1964\u20131965), Miyazaki moved from inbetween art to key animation, and worked in the latter role on two episodes of Sally the Witch (1966\u20131968) and several of Hustle Punch (1965\u20131966) and Rainbow Sentai Robin (1966\u20131967).",
  "Concerned that opportunities to work on creative projects and feature films would become scarce following an increase in animated television, Miyazaki volunteered in 1964 to work on the film The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun (1968); he was chief animator, concept artist, and scene designer, and was credited as \"scene designer\" to reflect his role. On the film, he worked closely with his mentor, Yasuo \u014ctsuka, whose approach to animation profoundly influenced Miyazaki's work. Directed by Takahata, the film was highly praised, and deemed a pivotal work in the evolution of animation, though its limited release and minimal promotion led to a disappointing box office result, among Toei Animation's worst, which threatened the studio financially.",
  "Miyazaki moved to a residence in Higashimurayama after his wedding in October 1965, to \u014cizumigakuench\u014d after the birth of his second son in April 1969, and to Tokorozawa in 1970.\nMiyazaki provided key animation for The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots (1969), directed by Kimio Yabuki. He created a 12-chapter manga series as a promotional tie-in for the film; the series ran in the Sunday edition of Tokyo Shimbun from January to March 1969. Miyazaki later proposed scenes in the screenplay for Flying Phantom Ship (1969) in which military tanks would cause mass hysteria in downtown Tokyo, and was hired to storyboard and animate the scenes.",
  "Miyazaki later proposed scenes in the screenplay for Flying Phantom Ship (1969) in which military tanks would cause mass hysteria in downtown Tokyo, and was hired to storyboard and animate the scenes. Beginning a shift towards slow-paced productions featuring mostly female protagonists, he provided key animation for Moomin (1969), two episodes of Himitsu no Akko-chan (1969\u20131970), and one episode of Sarutobi Ecchan (1971), and was organizer and key animator for Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (1971).",
  "Under the pseudonym Akitsu Sabur\u014d (\u79cb\u6d25 \u4e09\u6717), Miyazaki wrote and illustrated the manga People of the Desert, published in 26 installments between September 1969 and March 1970 in Boys and Girls Newspaper (\u5c11\u5e74\u5c11\u5973\u65b0\u805e, Sh\u014dnen sh\u014djo shinbun). He was influenced by illustrated stories such as Fukushima's Evil Lord of the Desert (\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b, Sabaku no ma\u014d). In 1971, Miyazaki developed structure, characters, and designs for Hiroshi Ikeda's adaptation of Animal Treasure Island, providing key animation and script development. He created the 13-part manga adaptation, printed in Tokyo Shimbun from January to March 1971.",
  "He created the 13-part manga adaptation, printed in Tokyo Shimbun from January to March 1971.\nMiyazaki left Toei Animation in August 1971, having become dissatisfied by the lack of creative prospects and autonomy, and by confrontations with management regarding The Great Adventure of Horus. He followed Takahata and Y\u014dichi Kotabe to A-Pro, where he directed, or co-directed with Takahata, 17 of the 23 episodes of Lupin the Third Part I, originally intended as a movie project. This was Miyazaki's directorial debut. He and Takahata were engaged to emphasize the series' humor over its violence.",
  "This was Miyazaki's directorial debut. He and Takahata were engaged to emphasize the series' humor over its violence. The two also began pre-production on a series based on Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking books, designing extensive storyboards; Miyazaki and Tokyo Movie Shinsha president Yutaka Fujioka traveled to Sweden to secure the rights\u2014Miyazaki's first trip outside Japan and possibly the first overseas trip for any Japanese animator for a production\u2014but the series was canceled after they were unable to meet Lindgren, and permission was refused to complete the project. Foreign travel left an impression on Miyazaki; using concepts, scripts, design, and animation from the project, he wrote, designed and animated two Panda! Go, Panda!",
  "Foreign travel left an impression on Miyazaki; using concepts, scripts, design, and animation from the project, he wrote, designed and animated two Panda! Go, Panda! shorts in 1972 and 1973, with Takahata as director and \u014ctsuka as animation director. Their choice of pandas was inspired by the panda craze in Japan at the time.\nMiyazaki drew storyboards for the first episode of The Gutsy Frog in 1971 (though they went unused), provided key animation and storyboards for two episodes of Akado Suzunosuke in 1972, and delivered key animation for one episode each of K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu (directed by Takahata) and Samurai Giants in 1973.",
  "In 1972, he directed a five-minute pilot film for the television series Yuki's Sun; the series was never produced, and the pilot fell into obscurity before resurfacing as part of a Blu-ray release of Miyazaki's works in 2014. In June 1973, Miyazaki and Takahata moved from A-Pro to Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d, where they worked on World Masterpiece Theater, which featured their animation series Heidi, Girl of the Alps, an adaptation of Johanna Spyri's Heidi. The production team wanted the series to set new heights for television animation, and Miyazaki traveled to Switzerland to research and sketch in preparation. Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d split into two companies in July 1975; Miyazaki and Takahata's branch became Nippon Animation.",
  "Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d split into two companies in July 1975; Miyazaki and Takahata's branch became Nippon Animation. They briefly worked on Dog of Flanders in 1975 before moving on to the larger-scale 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother (1976), directed by Takahata, for which Miyazaki traveled to Argentina and Italy as research.\nIn 1977, Miyazaki was chosen to direct his first animated television series, Future Boy Conan; he directed 24 of the 26 episodes, which were broadcast in 1978. Only eight episodes were completed when the series began airing; each episode was completed within ten to fourteen days.",
  "Only eight episodes were completed when the series began airing; each episode was completed within ten to fourteen days. An adaptation of Alexander Key's The Incredible Tide, the series features several elements that later reappeared in Miyazaki's work, such as warplanes, airplanes, and environmentalism. Also working on the series was Takahata, \u014ctsuka, and Yoshifumi Kond\u014d, whom Miyazaki and Takahata had met at A-Pro. Visually, Miyazaki was inspired by Paul Grimault's The Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird. Miyazaki did key animation for thirty episodes of the World Masterpiece Theater series Rascal the Raccoon (1977) and provided scene design and organization on the first fifteen episodes of Takahata's Anne of Green Gables before leaving Nippon Animation in 1979.",
  "=== Breakthrough films ===\nMiyazaki moved to Tokyo Movie Shinsha to direct his first feature anime film, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), an installment of the Lupin III franchise. \u014ctsuka had approached him to direct the film following the release of Lupin the 3rd: The Mystery of Mamo (1978), and Miyazaki wrote the story with Haruya Yamazaki. Wishing to insert his own creativity into the franchise, Miyazaki inserted several elements and references, inspired by several of Maurice Leblanc's Ars\u00e8ne Lupin novels, on which Lupin III is based, as well as The Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird. Visually, he was inspired by Kagoshima Publishing's Italian Mountain Cities and the Tiber Estuary, reflecting his love for Europe.",
  "Wonderbird. Visually, he was inspired by Kagoshima Publishing's Italian Mountain Cities and the Tiber Estuary, reflecting his love for Europe. Production ran for four months and the film was released on December 15, 1979; Miyazaki wished he could have had another month of production. It was well received; Animage readers voted it the best animation of all time\u2014it remained in the top ten for more than fifteen years\u2014and Clarisse the best heroine. In 2005, former princess Sayako Kuroda's wedding dress was reportedly inspired by Clarisse's, having been a fan of Miyazaki and his work. Several Japanese and American filmmakers were inspired by the film, prompting homages in other works.",
  "Several Japanese and American filmmakers were inspired by the film, prompting homages in other works.\nMiyazaki became a chief animation instructor for new employees at Telecom Animation Film, a subsidiary of Tokyo Movie Shinsha. and subsequently directed two episodes of Lupin the Third Part II under the pseudonym Teruki Tsutomu (\u7167\u6a39 \u52d9), which can read as \"employee of Telecom\". In his role at Telecom, Miyazaki helped train the second wave of employees.",
  "In his role at Telecom, Miyazaki helped train the second wave of employees. Miyazaki provided key animation for one episode of The New Adventures of Gigantor (1980\u20131981), and directed six episodes of Sherlock Hound in 1981, until legal issues with Arthur Conan Doyle's estate led to a suspension in production; Miyazaki was busy with other projects by the time the issues were resolved, and the remaining episodes were directed by Ky\u00f4suke Mikuriya and broadcast from November 1984 to May 1985. It was Miyazaki's final television work.",
  "It was Miyazaki's final television work. In 1982, Miyazaki, Takahata, and Kond\u014d started work on a film adaptation of Little Nemo, but Miyazaki and Takahata left after a few months due to creative clashes with Fujioka (Kond\u014d remained until 1985); the film was completed six years later as Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland (1989). Miyazaki spent some time in the United States during the film's production.\nAfter the release of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at Tokyo Movie Shinsha. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights.",
  "In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by Animage's editorial staff. Editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama took some of his ideas to Animage's parent company, Tokuma Shoten, which had been considering funding animated films. Two projects were proposed: Warring States Demon Castle (\u6226\u56fd\u9b54\u57ce, Sengoku ma-j\u014d), to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime not based on existing manga and the rights for Rowlf could not be secured. Elements of Miyazaki's proposal for Rowlf were recycled in his later works.",
  "Elements of Miyazaki's proposal for Rowlf were recycled in his later works.\nWith no films in production, Miyazaki agreed to develop a manga for the magazine, titled Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind; he had intended to stop making the manga when he received animation work; while he took some breaks in releases, the manga ultimately ran from February 1982 to March 1994. Miyazaki's busy schedule and perfectionist mindset led to several delays in publications, and on one occasion he withdrew some chapters before publication; he considered its continued publication a burden on his other work. The story, as re-printed in the tank\u014dbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1,060 pages. It sold more than ten million copies in its first two years.",
  "The story, as re-printed in the tank\u014dbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1,060 pages. It sold more than ten million copies in its first two years. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia-toned ink.",
  "It sold more than ten million copies in its first two years. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia-toned ink. The main character, Nausica\u00e4, was partly inspired by the character from Homer's Odyssey (whom Miyazaki had discovered while reading Bernard Evslin's Dictionary of Grecian Myths) and the Japanese folk tale The Lady who Loved Insects, while the world and ecosystem was based on Miyazaki's readings of scientific, historical, and political writings, such as Sasuke Nakao's Origins of Plant Cultivation and Agriculture, Eiichi Fujimori's The World of Jomon, Paul Carell's Hitler Moves East. He was also inspired by the comic series Arzach by Jean Giraud, whom he met while working on the manga.",
  "He was also inspired by the comic series Arzach by Jean Giraud, whom he met while working on the manga.\nIn 1982, Miyazaki assisted with key animation for an unreleased Zorro series, and for the feature film Space Adventure Cobra: The Movie. He resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November. Around this time, he wrote the graphic novel The Journey of Shuna, inspired by the Tibetan folk tale \"Prince who became a dog\". The novel was published by Tokuma Shoten in June 1983, dramatized for radio broadcast in 1987, and published in English as Shuna's Journey in 2022.",
  "The novel was published by Tokuma Shoten in June 1983, dramatized for radio broadcast in 1987, and published in English as Shuna's Journey in 2022. Hayao Miyazaki's Daydream Data Notes was also irregularly published from November 1984 to October 1994 in Model Graphix; selections of the stories received radio broadcast in 1995. Following the completion of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind's first two volumes, Animage editors suggested a 15-minute short film adaptation. Miyazaki, initially reluctant, countered that an hour-long animation would be more suitable, and Tokuma Shoten agreed on a feature-length film.",
  "Miyazaki, initially reluctant, countered that an hour-long animation would be more suitable, and Tokuma Shoten agreed on a feature-length film.\nProduction began on May 31, 1983, with animation beginning in August; funding was provided through a joint venture between Tokuma Shoten and the advertising agency Hakuhodo, for whom Miyazaki's youngest brother worked. Animation studio Topcraft was chosen as the production house. Miyazaki found some of Topcraft's staff unreliable, and brought on several of his previous collaborators, including Takahata, who served as producer, though he was reluctant to do so. Pre-production began on May 31, 1983; Miyazaki encountered difficulties in creating the screenplay, with only sixteen chapters of the manga to work with.",
  "Pre-production began on May 31, 1983; Miyazaki encountered difficulties in creating the screenplay, with only sixteen chapters of the manga to work with. Takahata enlisted experimental and minimalist musician Joe Hisaishi to compose the film's score; he subsequently worked on all of Miyazaki's feature films.\nFor the film, Miyazaki's imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the film's polluted world. For the lead role of Nausica\u00e4, Miyazaki cast Sumi Shimamoto, who had impressed him as Clarisse in The Castle of Cagliostro and Maki in Lupin the Third Part II.",
  "Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind was created in ten months, and released on March 11, 1984. It grossed \u00a51.48 billion at the box office, and made an additional \u00a5742 million in distribution income. It is often seen as Miyazaki's pivotal work, cementing his reputation as an animator. It was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly Nausica\u00e4. Several critics have labeled Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind as possessing anti-war and feminist themes; Miyazaki argues otherwise, stating he only wishes to entertain. He felt Nausica\u00e4's ability to understand her opponent rather than simply defeat them meant she had to be female. The successful cooperation on the creation of the manga and the film laid the foundation for other collaborative projects.",
  "The successful cooperation on the creation of the manga and the film laid the foundation for other collaborative projects. In April 1984, Miyazaki and Takahata created a studio to handle copyright of their work, naming it Nibariki (meaning \"Two-Horse Power\", the nickname for the Citro\u00ebn 2CV, which Miyazaki drove), for which an office was secured in Suginami Ward, with Miyazaki serving as the senior partner.\n\n\n=== Studio Ghibli ===",
  "=== Studio Ghibli ===\n\n\n==== Early films (1985\u20131995) ====\nFollowing the success of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, Miyazaki and Takahata founded the animation production company Studio Ghibli on June 15, 1985, as a subsidiary of Tokuma Shoten, with offices in Kichij\u014dji designed by Miyazaki. Miyazaki named the studio after the Caproni Ca.309 and the Italian word meaning \"a hot wind that blows in the desert\"; the name had been registered a year earlier.",
  "Miyazaki named the studio after the Caproni Ca.309 and the Italian word meaning \"a hot wind that blows in the desert\"; the name had been registered a year earlier. Suzuki worked for Studio Ghibli as producer, joining full-time in 1989, while Topcraft's T\u014dru Hara became production manager; Suzuki's role in the creation of the studio and its films has led him to being occasionally named a co-founder, and Hara is often viewed as influential to the company's success. Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the founder of Tokuma Shoten, was also closely related to the company's creation, having provided financial backing. Topcraft had been considered as a partner to produce Miyazaki's next film, but the company went bankrupt in 1985.",
  "Topcraft had been considered as a partner to produce Miyazaki's next film, but the company went bankrupt in 1985. Several staff members subsequently hired at Studio Ghibli\u2014up to 70 full-time and 200 part-time employees in 1985\u2014had previously worked with Miyazaki at different studios, such as Telecom, Topcraft, and Toei Doga, and others like Madhouse, Inc. and Oh! Production.\nIn 1984, Miyazaki traveled to Wales, drawing the mining villages and communities of Rhondda; he witnessed the miners' strike and admired the miners' dedication to their work and community. He was angered by the \"military superpowers\" of the Roman Empire who conquered the Celts and felt this anguish, alongside the miners' strike, was perceptible in Welsh communities.",
  "He was angered by the \"military superpowers\" of the Roman Empire who conquered the Celts and felt this anguish, alongside the miners' strike, was perceptible in Welsh communities. He returned in May 1985 to research his next film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, the first by Studio Ghibli. Its tight production schedule forced Miyazaki to work all day, including before and after normal working hours, and he wrote lyrics for its end theme. Miyazaki used the floating island of Laputa from Gulliver's Travels in the film. Laputa was released on August 2, 1986, by the Toei Company.",
  "Miyazaki used the floating island of Laputa from Gulliver's Travels in the film. Laputa was released on August 2, 1986, by the Toei Company. It sold around 775,000 tickets, making a modest financial return, though Miyazaki and Suzuki expressed their disappointment with its box office figures of approximately US$2.5 million.\nAfter the success of Nausica\u00e4, Miyazaki visited Yanagawa and considered imitating it in an animated film, fascinated by its canal system; instead, Takahata directed a live-action documentary about the region, The Story of Yanagawa's Canals (1987). Miyazaki produced and financed the film, and provided several animated sequences.",
  "Miyazaki produced and financed the film, and provided several animated sequences. Its creation spanned four years, and Miyazaki considered it his social responsibility\u2014to both Japanese society and filmmaking\u2014in seeing it produced. Laputa was created partly to fund production of the documentary, for which Takahata had depleted his funds. In June 1985, Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind was released in the United States as Warriors of the Wind, with significant cuts; almost 30 minutes of dialogue and character development were removed, erasing parts of its plot and themes. Miyazaki and Takahata subsequently refused to consider Western releases of their films for the following decade.",
  "Miyazaki and Takahata subsequently refused to consider Western releases of their films for the following decade.\nMiyazaki's next film, My Neighbor Totoro, originated in ideas he had as a child; he felt \"Totoro is where my consciousness began\". An attempt to pitch My Neighbor Totoro to Tokuma Shoten in the early 1980s had been unsuccessful, and Miyazaki faced difficulty in attempting to pitch it again in 1987. Suzuki proposed that Totoro be released as a double bill alongside Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies; as the latter, based on the 1967 short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, had historical value, Suzuki predicted school students would be taken to watch both.",
  "Totoro features the theme of the relationship between the environment and humanity, showing that harmony is the result of respecting the environment. The film also references Miyazaki's mother; the child protagonists' mother is bedridden. As with Laputa, Miyazaki wrote lyrics for Totoro's end theme. Miyazaki struggled with the film's script until he read a Mainichi Graph story about Japan forty years prior, opting to set the film in the country before Tokyo's expansion and the advent of television. Miyazaki has subsequently donated money and artwork to fund preservation of the forested land in Saitama Prefecture, in which the film is set.\nProduction of My Neighbor Totoro began in April 1987 and took exactly a year; it was released on April 16, 1988.",
  "Production of My Neighbor Totoro began in April 1987 and took exactly a year; it was released on April 16, 1988. While the film received critical acclaim, it was only moderately successful at the box office. Studio Ghibli approved merchandising rights in 1990, which led to major commercial success; merchandise profits alone were able to sustain the studio for years. The film was labeled a cult classic, eventually gaining success in the United States after its release in 1993, where its home video release sold almost 500,000 copies. Akira Kurosawa said the film moved him, naming it among his hundred favorite films\u2014one of few Japanese films to be named.

  "An asteroid discovered by Takao Kobayashi in December 1994 was named after the film: 10160 Totoro.\nIn 1987, Studio Ghibli acquired the rights to create a film adaptation of Eiko Kadono's novel Kiki's Delivery Service. Miyazaki's work on My Neighbor Totoro prevented him from directing the adaptation; he acted as producer, while Sunao Katabuchi was chosen as director and Nobuyuki Isshiki as script writer. Miyazaki's dissatisfaction of Isshiki's first draft led him to make changes to the project, ultimately taking the role of director. Kadono expressed her dissatisfaction with the differences between the book and screenplay, but Miyazaki and Takahata convinced her to let production continue.",
  "Kadono expressed her dissatisfaction with the differences between the book and screenplay, but Miyazaki and Takahata convinced her to let production continue. The film was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film after Miyazaki completed the storyboards and screenplay. Miyazaki felt the struggles of the protagonist, Kiki, reflected the feelings of young girls in Japan yearning to live independently in cities, while her talents reflected those of real girls, despite her magical powers. In preparation for production, Miyazaki and other senior staff members traveled to Sweden, where they captured eighty rolls of film in Stockholm and Visby, the former being the primary inspiration behind the film's city.

Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli personally approved the subsequent English translations.\nFrom March to May 1989, Miyazaki's manga Hik\u014dtei Jidai was published in the magazine Model Graphix, based on an earlier film idea he had assigned to a younger director in 1988 that fell through due to creative differences.",
  "Miyazaki began production on a 45-minute in-flight film for Japan Airlines based on the manga; Suzuki extended it into a feature-length film, titled Porco Rosso, as expectations and budget grew. Miyazaki began work on the film with little assistance, as its production overlapped with Takahata's Only Yesterday (1991), which Miyazaki co-produced. The outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars in 1991 affected Miyazaki, prompting a more sombre tone for Porco Rosso; the Croatian War of Independence moved the film's setting from Dubrovnik to the Adriatic Sea. Miyazaki later referred to the film as \"foolish\", as its mature tones were unsuitable for children, noting he had made it for his \"own pleasure\" due to his love of planes.",

Japan Airlines remained a major investor in the film, resulting in its initial premiere as an in-flight film, prior to its theatrical release on July 18, 1992.

The studio opened in August 1992, and the staff moved in shortly after Porco Rosso's release.

The landscapes in the film were inspired by Yakushima. In Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki revisited the ecological and political themes of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind.

Miyazaki felt Abe wished to \"leave his name in history as a great man who revised the Constitution and its interpretation\", describing it as \"despicable\" and stating \"People who don't think enough shouldn't meddle with the constitution\". In 2015, Miyazaki disapproved Abe's denial of Japan's military aggression, stating Japan \"should clearly say that [they] inflicted enormous damage on China and express deep remorse over it\".",
  "In 2015, Miyazaki disapproved Abe's denial of Japan's military aggression, stating Japan \"should clearly say that [they] inflicted enormous damage on China and express deep remorse over it\". He felt the government should give a \"proper apology\" to Korean comfort women who were forced to service the Japanese army during World War II and suggested the Senkaku Islands be \"split in half\" or controlled by both Japan and China. After the release of The Wind Rises in 2013, some online critics labeled Miyazaki a \"traitor\" and \"anti-Japanese\", describing the film as overly \"left-wing\"; Miyazaki recognized leftist values in his movies, citing his influence by and appreciation of communism as defined by Karl Marx, but criticized the Soviet Union's political system.",
  "When Spirited Away was nominated at the 75th Academy Awards in 2003, Miyazaki refused to attend in protest of the United States's involvement in the Iraq War, and later said he \"didn't want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq\". He did not publicly express this opinion at the request of his producer until 2009 when he lifted his boycott and attended San Diego Comic-Con as a favor to his friend John Lasseter. Miyazaki also expressed his opinion about the terrorist attack at the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, criticizing the magazine's decision to publish the content cited as the catalyst for the incident; he felt caricatures should be made of politicians, not cultures.",
  "In November 2016, Miyazaki believed \"many of the people who voted for Brexit and Trump\" were affected by the increase in unemployment due to companies \"building cars in Mexico because of low wages and [selling] them in the US\". He did not think Donald Trump would be elected president, calling it \"a terrible thing\", but said Trump's political opponent Hillary Clinton was \"terrible as well\".\n\n\n== Themes ==\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as feminism, environmentalism, pacifism, love, and family. His narratives are also notable for not pitting a hero against an unsympathetic antagonist; Miyazaki felt Spirited Away's Chihiro \"manages not because she has destroyed the 'evil', but because she has acquired the ability to survive\".",
  "Miyazaki's films often emphasize environmentalism and the Earth's fragility. Margaret Talbot stated Miyazaki dislikes modern technology, and believes much of modern culture is \"thin and shallow and fake\"; he anticipates a time with \"no more high-rises\". Miyazaki felt frustrated growing up in the Sh\u014dwa period from 1955 to 1965 because \"nature\u2014the mountains and rivers\u2014was being destroyed in the name of economic progress\". Peter Schellhase of The Imaginative Conservative identified that several antagonists of Miyazaki's films \"attempt to dominate nature in pursuit of political domination, and are ultimately destructive to both nature and human civilization\".",
  "Peter Schellhase of The Imaginative Conservative identified that several antagonists of Miyazaki's films \"attempt to dominate nature in pursuit of political domination, and are ultimately destructive to both nature and human civilization\". Miyazaki is critical of exploitation under both communism and capitalism, as well as globalization and its effects on modern life, believing \"a company is common property of the people that work there\". Ram Prakash Dwivedi identified values of Mahatma Gandhi in the films of Miyazaki.\nSeveral of Miyazaki's films feature anti-war themes. Daisuke Akimoto of Animation Studies categorized Porco Rosso as \"anti-war propaganda\" and felt the protagonist, Porco, transforms into a pig partly due to his extreme distaste of militarism.",
  "Daisuke Akimoto of Animation Studies categorized Porco Rosso as \"anti-war propaganda\" and felt the protagonist, Porco, transforms into a pig partly due to his extreme distaste of militarism. Akimoto also argues that The Wind Rises reflects Miyazaki's \"antiwar pacifism\", despite Miyazaki stating that the film does not attempt to \"denounce\" war. Schellhase also identifies Princess Mononoke as a pacifist film due to the protagonist, Ashitaka; instead of joining the campaign of revenge against humankind, as his ethnic history would lead him to do, Ashitaka strives for peace.",
  "David Loy and Linda Goodhew argue both Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke do not depict traditional evil, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will, and delusion; according to Buddhism, the roots of evil must transform into \"generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom\" in order to overcome suffering, and both Nausica\u00e4 and Ashitaka accomplish this. When characters in Miyazaki's films are forced to engage in violence, it is shown as being a difficult task; in Howl's Moving Castle, Howl is forced to fight an inescapable battle in defense of those he loves, and it almost destroys him, though he is ultimately saved by Sophie's love and bravery.\nSuzuki described Miyazaki as a feminist in reference to his attitude to female workers.",
  "Suzuki described Miyazaki as a feminist in reference to his attitude to female workers. Miyazaki has described his female characters as \"brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart\", stating they may \"need a friend, or a supporter, but never a saviour\" and \"any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man\". Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly protagonist Nausica\u00e4. Schellhase noted the female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions.",
  "Schellhase noted the female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions. Schellhase also identified a \"coming of age\" element for the heroines in Miyazaki's films, as they each discover \"individual personality and strengths\". Gabrielle Bellot of The Atlantic wrote that, in his films, Miyazaki \"shows a keen understanding of the complexities of what it might mean to be a woman\". In particular, Bellot cites Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, praising the film's challenging of gender expectations, and the strong and independent nature of Nausica\u00e4. Bellot also noted Princess Mononoke's San represents the \"conflict between selfhood and expression\".",
  "Bellot also noted Princess Mononoke's San represents the \"conflict between selfhood and expression\".\nMiyazaki is concerned with the sense of wonder in young people, seeking to maintain themes of love and family in his films. Michael Toscano of Curator found Miyazaki \"fears Japanese children are dimmed by a culture of overconsumption, overprotection, utilitarian education, careerism, techno-industrialism, and a secularism that is swallowing Japan's native animism\". Schellhase wrote that several of Miyazaki's works feature themes of love and romance, but felt emphasis is placed on \"the way lonely and vulnerable individuals are integrated into relationships of mutual reliance and responsibility, which generally benefit everyone around them\".",
  "He also found many of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films present an idealized image of families, whereas others are dysfunctional.\n\n\n== Creation process and influences ==\nMiyazaki forgoes traditional screenplays in his productions, instead developing the narrative as he designs the storyboards, stating \"We never know where the story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops\". Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods in all of his films, drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films, beginning with Princess Mononoke, to \"enrich the visual look\", though he ensures each film can \"retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer ... and still be able to call my films 2D\". He oversees every frame of his films.",
  "He oversees every frame of his films. For character designs, Miyazaki draws original drafts used by animation directors to create reference sheets, which are then corrected by Miyazaki in his style.\nMiyazaki has cited several Japanese artists as his influences, including Sanpei Shirato, Osamu Tezuka, Soji Yamakawa, and Isao Takahata, and Western artists and animators like Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Back, Jean Giraud, Paul Grimault, Yuri Norstein, and animation studio Aardman Animations (specifically the works of Nick Park).",
  "A number of authors have also influenced his works, including Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, Ursula K. Le Guin, Philippa Pearce, Rosemary Sutcliff, and Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Specific works that have influenced Miyazaki include Animal Farm (1945), The Snow Queen (1957), and The King and the Mockingbird (1980); The Snow Queen is said to be the true catalyst for Miyazaki's filmography, influencing his training and work. When animating young children, Miyazaki often takes inspiration from his friends' children and memories of his own childhood.",
  "When animating young children, Miyazaki often takes inspiration from his friends' children and memories of his own childhood.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nMiyazaki's wife, Akemi \u014cta (\u5927\u7530\u6731\u7f8e), was born in 1938 and hired as an inbetween artist at Toei Animation in 1958, working on Panda and the Magic Serpent and Alakazam the Great (1960). She and Miyazaki met at Toei in 1964, and they married in October 1965. At Toei, they worked together on The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun and The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots. They have two sons: Goro, born in January 1967, and Keisuke, born in April 1969.",
  "They have two sons: Goro, born in January 1967, and Keisuke, born in April 1969. Becoming a father changed Miyazaki and he tried to produce work to please his children.\nMiyazaki initially fulfilled a promise to his wife that they would both continue to work after Goro's birth, dropping him off at preschool for the day; however, upon seeing Goro's exhaustion walking home one day, Miyazaki decided they could not continue, and his wife quit in 1972 to stay at home and raise their children. She was reluctant to do so but considered it necessary to allow Miyazaki to focus on his work. Miyazaki's dedication to his work harmed his relationship with his children as he was often absent.",
  "She was reluctant to do so but considered it necessary to allow Miyazaki to focus on his work. Miyazaki's dedication to his work harmed his relationship with his children as he was often absent. Goro watched his father's works to \"understand\" him since the two rarely talked. Miyazaki said he \"tried to be a good father, but in the end [he] wasn't a very good parent\". During production of Tales from Earthsea in 2006, Goro said his father \"gets zero marks as a father but full marks as a director of animated films\".\nGoro worked at a landscape design firm before beginning to work at the Ghibli Museum; he designed the garden on its rooftop and eventually became its curator.",
  "Goro worked at a landscape design firm before beginning to work at the Ghibli Museum; he designed the garden on its rooftop and eventually became its curator. Keisuke studied forestry at Shinshu University and works as a wood artist; he designed a woodcut print that appears in Whisper of the Heart. Miyazaki's niece, Mei Okuyama, who was the inspiration behind the character Mei in My Neighbor Totoro, is married to animation artist Daisuke Tsutsumi.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMiyazaki was described as the \"godfather of animation in Japan\" by BBC's Tessa Wong in 2016, citing his craftsmanship and humanity, the themes of his films, and his inspiration to younger artists.",
  "Courtney Lanning of Arkansas Democrat-Gazette named him one of the world's greatest animators, comparing him to Osamu Tezuka and Walt Disney; Miyazaki has been called \"the Disney of Japan\", though Helen McCarthy considered comparison to Akira Kurosawa more appropriate due to the combination of grandeur and sensitivity in his work, dubbing him \"the Kurosawa of animation\". Swapnil Dhruv Bose of Far Out Magazine wrote that Miyazaki's work \"has shaped not only the future of animation but also filmmaking in general\", and that it helped \"generation after generation of young viewers to observe the magic that exists in the mundane\". Richard James Havis of South China Morning Post called him a \"genius ... who sets exacting standards for himself, his peers and studio staff\".",
  "Richard James Havis of South China Morning Post called him a \"genius ... who sets exacting standards for himself, his peers and studio staff\". Paste's Toussaint Egan described Miyazaki as \"one of anime's great auteurs\", whose \"stories of such singular thematic vision and unmistakable aesthetic\" captured viewers otherwise unfamiliar with anime. Miyazaki became the subject of an exhibit at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles in 2021, featuring over 400 objects from his films.",
  "Miyazaki became the subject of an exhibit at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles in 2021, featuring over 400 objects from his films.\nMiyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration to numerous animators, directors and writers around the world, including Wes Anderson, Tony Bancroft, James Cameron, Barry Cook, Dean DeBlois, Guillermo del Toro, Pete Docter, Mamoru Hosoda, Bong Joon-ho, Travis Knight, John Lasseter, Nick Park, Henry Selick, Makoto Shinkai, and Steven Spielberg.

  "Glen Keane said Miyazaki is a \"huge influence\" on Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been \"part of our heritage\" ever since The Rescuers Down Under (1990). The Disney Renaissance era was also prompted by competition with the development of Miyazaki's films. Artists from Pixar and Aardman Studios signed a tribute stating, \"You're our inspiration, Miyazaki-san!\" He has also been cited as inspiration for video game designers including Shigeru Miyamoto on The Legend of Zelda and Hironobu Sakaguchi on Final Fantasy, as well as the television series Avatar: The Last Airbender, and the video game Ori and the Blind Forest (2015).",
  "Several books have been written about Miyazaki by scholars such as Raz Greenberg, Helen McCarthy, and Susan J. Napier; according to Jeff Lenburg, more papers have been written about Miyazaki than any other Japanese artist. Studio Ghibli has searched for some time for Miyazaki and Suzuki's successor to lead the studio; Kond\u014d, the director of Whisper of the Heart, was initially considered, but died from a sudden heart attack in 1998.
